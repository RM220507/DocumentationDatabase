# Documentation Database

PLEASE NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS NOT DEPRECIATED AND HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE 'PROJECT MANAGER' PROJECT.

This project was designed as a way to store many links to different tutorials, datasheets and documentation in one simple place.
The interface provides an easy-to-use and intuitive front-end to a MySQL database that runs on a server machine.
